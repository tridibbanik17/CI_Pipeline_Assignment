## About The Project

This project is a simple command-line quiz program written in C. It presents the user with questions about Linux, C programming, and Git, and checks the user's answers. The program is designed to be interacted with through command-line flags. A GitHub Actions workflow is included to automatically build the program on every push to the `main` branch.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Quiz:** Asks the user questions about Linux, C, and Git.
- **Answer Checking:** Determines if the user's answer is correct.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Uses command-line flags for interaction.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build process using GitHub Actions.

## Architecture

The project consists of a single C source file (`quiz.c`) that contains the quiz logic. The `build.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory defines the GitHub Actions workflow, which uses `gcc` to compile the C code into an executable named `quiz`. The compiled executable is then uploaded as an artifact.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A Linux or macOS environment (for running the compiled executable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tridibbanik17/ci_pipeline_assignment
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd tridibbanik17-ci_pipeline_assignment
   ```
3. Compile the C code:
   ```sh
   gcc -o quiz quiz.c
   ```
4. Run the quiz:
   ```sh
   ./quiz -1
   ./quiz -1 "vi"
   ./quiz --help
   ```
